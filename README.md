# holiday-app

> A holiday booking app built with VueJs

# Extra Information

> The essence of listing the features under each package is to influence the decision-making of whoever intends to book a package. The FAQ and the Testimonial Sections were added for the same reason because one way or the other, these information affect a visitor as to whether or not the booking site is reliable, whether the packages are actually worth it, etc.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
